# runPas-FC
tiny bash script and toolchain to run Pascal-FC code

## Usage
1) clone the repository (pccomp is the compiler, pint the interpreter, as binaries)
2) give execution permissons to all 3 files: ```chmod u+x runPas.sh pint pfccomp```
3) run the script with your .pas file as an argument ```./runPas.sh yourCode.pas [-k/-c]```
   - Use **-k** to **k**eep the files generated by the compiler and interpreter.
   - Use **-c** to **c**leanup the files generated by -k.
4) type **q** and press **ENTER** to exit the interpreter. It will clean the temp files by default.

## View compilation bugs
You can see compiler output in the .lst file, to see any errors: ```cat yourCode.pas.lst```
